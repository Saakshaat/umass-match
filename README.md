# umass-match

U-Match is a first of its kind people-matching platform. Built to bring the community together and provide our users with a platform to meet and socialize with their UMass fellows, U-Match focuses on matching people based on commonalities.

Our users can request a match and, unlike most other matching-apps, U-Match will run an algorithm against our user-base to generate a match itself. The match is based on similarities such as majors, current/past UMass residences, clubs, interests in music, movie and video game genres and much more.

The only catch is that you can only request a match every 3 days! This is meant to give our users the time to reach out to their matches and take the time to get to know them. Since U-Match creates the matches based on our own algorithm, which also randomly chooses from the final list of filtered users, it opens up the possibilities for our users to meet new people. Our app also makes sure that our users only match with people they've never matched with before, creating greater potential for them to expand their social network.

The beauty of our project lies in its simplicity. U-Match only requires basic data like the user's major(/s), clubs, where they've lived on UMass and their interests, and uses these simple parameters to generate an intelligent match. There is a lot of value in being minimal and our app explores this philosophy down to its algorithm.
